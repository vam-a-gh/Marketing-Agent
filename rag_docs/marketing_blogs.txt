As a marketer, I know that a marketing strategy is essential to nurture future clients, improve my business’s bottom line, and increase the ROI of my efforts. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy — 74% of small and medium businesses say they lack confidence in their marketing strategies.

To stay consistent and see powerful results, you need a clear roadmap for your objectives, audience, positioning, and tactics.

Here, I’ll share the critical components of an effective marketing strategy, complete with data from HubSpot’s latest State of Marketing report and a free marketing template so you can hit the ground running.

What is a marketing strategy?

A marketing strategy covers a company’s overall approach for promoting its brand to a target audience. The process involves research, goal-setting, and positioning. 




A completed marketing strategy typically includes brand objectives, target audience personas, marketing channels, key performance indicators, and more. Overall, 82% of marketers say they believe their marketing strategies are effective.
I’ve found that a marketing strategy will:

Align your team to specific goals
Help you tie your efforts to business objectives
Allow you to identify and test what resonates with your target audience
Empower you to capitalize on emerging consumer trends

Marketing Strategy vs. Marketing Plan
I like to think of a marketing strategy as outlining the long-term goals and overall approach, while a marketing plan covers the specific actions and tactics to achieve those goals.
In other words, marketing strategy guides a business's overall approach to marketing. It includes goal-setting, market and competitor research, and messaging and positioning for a brand.
For example, say you’re creating a marketing strategy for a new fashion brand. Your strategy might target young Gen Z students and position the brand as trendy and affordable.
But, a strategic marketing plan is a detailed tactical roadmap that outlines the specific actions and tactics that should achieve the marketing strategy’s goals.
For example, the marketing plan for the fashion brand mentioned above might include:

Targeted social media campaigns
Influencer partnerships
Online advertising timeline

Both a marketing strategy and a marketing plan are essential for a business’s success.
To succeed with the fast pace of change, stay relevant with your audience, and integrate AI in marketing, it’s vital to stay ahead of the curve.
Below, I’m going to show you step by step how to create a comprehensive marketing strategy. But first, let’s go over the individual components that make up a strong marketing strategy.



Marketing Strategy Components


Marketing Objectives
Marketing Mix
Marketing Budget
Competitive Analysis
Audience Segmentation, Targeting, and Personalization Strategy
Content Strategy
Metrics & Key Performance Indicators





1. Marketing Objectives

Believe it or not, “gaining more customers” isn’t the only marketing objective to consider. While one company may want to focus on lead generation and customer acquisition, another may want to increase brand awareness and industry authority. Others may prioritize customer engagement, loyalty, and referrals.
I always recommend that you outline your marketing objectives before building upon your strategy. Why? Because your goals will inform other components of the plan, including the budget and content creation process.
With every objective, be as specific as possible. Aim to create SMART marketing goals divided by channel or promotional tactic, and don’t forget that you can always come back and revise your goals as your priorities change.
2. Marketing Mix

The marketing mix, also known as the four Ps of marketing, is the preliminary framework you must create to understand what you will be marketing, where you’ll be marketing it, and how you’ll be marketing it.
The following P’s make up this framework:

Product: What are you selling?
Price: What is the price?
Place: Where will you be selling the product?
Promotion: Where will you be promoting the product?










































Once you have these broad strokes, you can extrapolate this information into a full-fledged marketing plan for each promotional channel.
3. Marketing Budget

A marketing budget is an essential element of your strategy. Without allocating funds to hire the right talent, use the right software, advertise on the right channels, and create the right content, your marketing strategy can’t succeed. To get a high return on investment, you must first invest.
Pro tip: Remember that you can always start small — hyper-focusing your budget on one or two efforts — and build upon them once you generate an ROI.
4. Competitive Analysis

Knowing your competition is key when creating a marketing strategy. With a competitive analysis, you will know where your marketing and positioning stand in relation to the market.
You might already have an idea of who your competitors are, but I think it’s still essential to sit down and analyze them. You may end up uncovering a surprise competitor who’s vying for your target buyer’s attention and engagement.
With this analysis, you can position your brand alongside other brands. What do you do better than your competitors? It’s essential to map this information when creating a marketing strategy— grab HubSpot’s free competitive analysis template to get started.
5. Audience Segmentation, Targeting, and Personalization Strategy

Segmentation and targeting refer to the process of delivering more relevant, personalized messages to target audiences. In other words, rather than blasting out generic campaigns to everyone, you’ll go through a methodical process for creating content that resonates with specific audiences.
Personalized marketing is more important than ever: 96% of marketers report that personalized experiences have increased sales. Segmentation and personalization at scale are game-changers for B2B marketers using AI to boost engagement and conversion rates.
During this process, you’ll take three steps:

Identify your target audience. Carry out market research, interview customers, and create buyer personas detailing your audience’s needs, wants, and pain points.
Target a segment of your target audience. It’s better to speak to a narrow group of highly qualified buyers than to send your message out to everyone.
Outline a segmentation and personalization strategy. Document how you will reach different audiences, including how AI and other tools will help you personalize at scale.

6. Content Strategy
Once you have your budget, competitive outlook, and targeting information, it’s time to create a content strategy. First, refer back to the marketing channels chosen in your marketing mix.
A content strategy should outline the content formats best for your audience and the goals for your content— whether that’s to educate, entertain, or generate conversions.
7. Metrics & Key Performance Indicators
Last but certainly not least, your marketing strategy must include metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure how well you’re performing.
The KPIs you choose will vary depending on your business type and preferred customer acquisition channels. Examples of KPIs include:

Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
Organic traffic
Conversion rate
Marketing qualified leads (MQLs).

Now, let’s dive into why it’s important to follow the steps of a marketing strategy.

Why is a marketing strategy important?
Without a defined strategy, you’ll essentially be throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. And that process will cost you money, time, and resources.
A robust marketing strategy will reach your target audience and have the power to turn people who’ve never heard of your brand into loyal repeat customers.
Here are just a few of the top reasons I think a marketing strategy is essential:
Offers Direction
A marketing strategy outlines clear goals and defines the path to achieve them. It pulls together all marketing efforts within an organization for optimal effects.
Targets the Right Audience
A well-defined marketing strategy helps you find and understand your target audience. This helps your business tailor your messaging and positioning to reach the right people at the right time.
Builds Brand Identity
A marketing strategy helps you create a consistent and cohesive brand identity. This makes it easier to align all marketing initiatives for increased brand recognition and loyalty.
Maximizes ROI
With analysis of market trends, competition, and customer behavior, marketing strategies help businesses find the most effective marketing channels and tactics to invest in. This helps businesses get the maximum return on investment.
Evaluates Performance
A marketing strategy defines key metrics and performance indicators. This makes it easier for your business to measure and track the success of marketing initiatives. It also gives you what you need to make data-driven decisions and optimize future campaigns for better results.



Marketing Strategy Process


Conduct market research.
Define your goals.
Identify your target audience and create buyer personas.
Conduct competitive analysis.
Develop key messaging.
Choose your marketing channels.
Create, track, and analyze KPIs.
Create a content strategy.
Create an AI strategy for marketing.
Present your marketing strategy.





1. Conduct market research.
Before you can begin creating your marketing strategy, you need to gather useful data to make informed decisions. Market research is like playing detective, but instead of solving crimes, you uncover juicy details about your customers.
I believe that market research is important because it helps your business make data-driven decisions for your marketing strategy. It also makes it easier to understand your target market, find gaps, and make the most of your resources.
This process is essential for understanding your customers and adapting to changing trends. If you’re new to this process, this complete market research guide and template can help.
Once you have the data you need, you’ll be ready to set some marketing goals.
2. Define your goals.
What do you want to achieve through your marketing efforts?
Well-defined goals will guide your marketing strategy, whether you’re increasing brand awareness, driving sales, or diversifying your customer base. Your marketing strategy goals should reflect your business goals. They should also offer clear direction for marketing efforts.
For example, say one of your business goals is to increase market share by 20% within a year. Your goal as a marketer could include expanding into new target markets, updating your brand, or driving customer acquisition.
Other marketing goals might be to increase brand awareness or generate high-quality leads. You might also want to grow or maintain thought leadership in your industry or increase customer value.
I find that defining clear goals provides direction and clarity, guiding marketing efforts toward desired outcomes. It helps with resource allocation, decision-making, and measuring the success of marketing initiatives.
I recommend this SMART goal guide which can help you with more effective goal-setting.
3. Identify your target audience and create buyer personas.
To create an effective marketing strategy, you need to understand who your ideal customers are. I suggest taking a look at your market research to understand your target audience and market landscape. Accurate customer data is especially important for this step.
But it’s not enough to know who your audience is. Once you’ve figured out who they are, you need to understand what they want. This isn’t just their needs and pain points. It’s how your product or service can solve their problems.
So, if you can’t define who your audience is in one sentence, now’s your chance to do it. Create a buyer persona that’s a snapshot of your ideal customer.









































Buyer Persona Example
For example, a store like Macy’s could define a buyer persona as Budgeting Belinda, a stylish working-class woman in her 30s living in a suburb, looking to fill her closet with designer deals at low prices.
With this description, Macy’s marketing department can picture Budgeting Belinda and work with a clear definition in mind.
Buyer personas have critical demographic and psychographic information. This can include:

Age
Job title
Income
Location
Interests
Challenges

Notice how I included all those attributes in Belinda’s description.
For B2B SaaS companies, keep in mind that buyer personas don’t apply solely to the end user. When you’re selling a product to another business, you also have to address the decision-maker, the financial buyer, and the technical advisor, among other roles, says Head of Marketing at Entrapeer, Hillary Lyons.
“You need to be able to tailor your message to each of these unique personas even though most of them will never actually use the product,” says Lyons. “You have to sell each of them on the unparalleled benefit you provide without muddling your [overall] message.”
You don’t have to create your buyer persona with a pen and paper. In fact, HubSpot offers a free template you can use to make your own (and it’s really fun).
You can also use a platform like Versium, which helps you identify, understand, and reach your target audience through data and artificial intelligence.
Buyer personas should be at the core of your strategy.

4. Conduct competitive analysis.
Now that you have an understanding of your customers, it’s time to see who you’re competing with to get their attention.
To begin your competitive analysis, start with your top competitors. Reviewing their websites, content, ads, and pricing can help you understand how to differentiate your brand. I think it’s also a useful way to find growth opportunities.
But how do you know which competitors are most important? These competitive analysis templates will walk you through the process. I like it because it will help you choose and evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and strategies of your competitors.
This process will help you find market gaps, spot trends, and figure out which marketing tactics will be most effective. Competitive analysis can also offer valuable insights into pricing, positioning, and marketing channels.
5. Develop key messaging.
You’ve figured out who you’re talking to, what they’ve already heard, and what they want to hear. Now, it’s time to share your brand’s unique value proposition.
In this step, you’ll craft key messaging that shows the benefits of your product or service that resonate with your target audience. This process should show off the research and work you have done up to this point. It should also incorporate your creativity, inventiveness, and willingness to experiment.
In my experience, well-crafted key messaging:

Sets businesses apart from the competition
Resonates with the target audience
Is flexible enough to be consistent across all marketing channels
Builds brand credibility
Creates an emotional connection with customers
Influences buying decisions

The key messaging in your marketing strategy is critical to driving engagement, loyalty, and business growth. These value proposition templates can help if you’re not sure how to draft this important messaging.
6. Choose your marketing channels.
You know what you want to say. Now, decide on the best marketing channels for your message. Your top goal for this stage of your strategy is to align your channel choices with your target persona’s media consumption habits and interests.
Start with media channels you’re already using. Then, consider a mix of traditional and digital channels. The top channels used for marketing in 2025 according to Salesforce are social media, website/app, digital ads, email marketing, and email.

Source
For social media, you’ll need to determine which specific channels are best to reach your audience. Consider your audience’s demographics when making a choice and limit yourself to social channels where you know you can produce high-quality, consistent content.

Source
To streamline this process, I like to think of your assets in three categories— paid, owned, and earned media.
Paid Media

Paid media is any channel you spend money on to attract your target audience. Most of this spending is on advertising. This includes online and offline channels like:

Television/streaming
Direct mail
Out-of-home advertising like billboards
Social media ads
SEM (search engine marketing)
Podcast advertising










































Owned Media

Source
Owned media refers to (mostly) online channels your brand owns, including:

Blogs
Websites
Organic social media

It also refers to the media your marketing team creates, such as

Videos.
Podcasts and audio content.
Ebooks.
Infographics.

Earned Media
Another way to say earned media is user-generated content. Earned media includes:

Shares on social media.
Posts about your business on X or Threads.
Reels posted on Instagram mentioning your brand.
Organic news stories about your company.


To decide which marketing channels are best for your marketing strategy, look carefully at each channel. Think about which channels are best for reaching your audience, staying within budget, and meeting your goals.
For example, a business targeting a younger demographic, like Gen Z, might consider using TikTok or Reddit to reach its audience.
It’s also important to choose a number of channels that’s manageable for your team and budget. 82% of small and medium businesses agree that using multiple marketing channels generates better results, but it’s important to avoid taking on too much. It’s much better to market on three channels well than on 10 channels poorly.
I suggest looking at your content strategy as a whole to get a clear vision of how you can integrate different content formats and channels into your strategy.
For example, say you already have a blog that’s rolling out weekly content in your niche (owned media). You might consider promoting your blog posts on Threads (owned media), which customers might then repost (earned media). Ultimately, that will help you create a better, more well-rounded marketing strategy.
7. Create, track, and analyze KPIs.
Once you have a clear outline of your marketing strategy, you’ll need to think about how you’ll measure whether it’s working.
At this stage, you’ll shift from marketing detective to numbers nerd. With a little planning and prep, your analytics can unveil the mysteries of marketing performance and unlock super insights.
Review your strategy and choose measurable KPIs to track the effectiveness of your efforts. Pick a marketing analytics software solution that works for your team to collect and measure your data.
​​

Ideally, I recommend choosing an analytics platform that allows you to track data across all of your marketing channels — from emails to social media and your website. This centralizes all of your data, which makes it easier to understand how each channel contributes to your overall strategy.
You can then plan to check and analyze the performance of your strategy over time and identify the channels that bring the best results. This can help you refine your approach based on results and feedback.
Lexi Boese, an ecommerce growth strategist and co-founder of The Digital Opportunists, recommends making data a priority when building your marketing strategy.
“The more data you can use, the easier you can track your success,” she says. “This could be as simple as understanding which channels convert the highest amount of customers (to determine how your team should prioritize ad spend), or assessing whether you have a higher amount of first-time or returning customers to [determine] if you should focus on internal or external marketing.”
Analyzing KPIs helps businesses stay agile, refine their strategies, and adapt to evolving customer needs.

8. Create a content strategy.
Think of a content strategy like a plan for how you want to communicate with people through things like social media posts, blog articles, videos, or even emails.
You already know who you're trying to reach, but this determines how you’re going to say it and in which format. A content strategy should outline the type of content you’ll share, goals, how often, and editorial calendars for planning content.
In 2025, multimedia content and visual storytelling are king. According to the State of Marketing, 30% of marketers use short-form videos as part of their content strategy, and 31% say it generates the highest ROI of all content creation formats.

Source
It’s even more essential to invest in formats that have a high ROI, such as short-form video, audio content, and user-generated content. Consider adding podcast and audio content to your strategy: 91% of marketers planned to increase their investment in podcasts and audio content in 2025, and 46% of weekly podcast listeners have purchased a product or service after hearing about it on a podcast.

Source
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest in text-based content like SEO and blogging. It’s simply important to be strategic about where you allot the most resources, in my opinion, especially if you have a limited budget.
9. Create an AI strategy for marketing.
Your boss may have asked you how you plan on using AI this year. If you’re like me, you’re learning on the fly. 48% of marketing leaders have invested in AI tools for their teams, but just 47% of marketers have a clear understanding of how to use AI in their marketing strategy.
Let’s be clear, AI isn’t a marketing strategy on its own.
It’s simply a tool that can make everything else— identifying buyer personas, creating personalized content, prospecting, and even analytics— faster and more effective. 75% of marketers say they use AI to reduce manual task time, and 86% say that AI saves them over an hour a day.
In your marketing strategy, document how you plan to integrate AI into your processes and workflows.
Examples of AI in Marketing Strategy

Analyzing your target audience and their wants, needs, and desire.
Writing a first draft of emails, blog posts, or website content.
Using buyer signals in your CRM to send hyper-personalized campaigns.

10. Present your marketing strategy.
A finished marketing strategy will pull together the sections and components above. It may also include:
Executive Summary
A concise overview that outlines the marketing goals, target audience, and key marketing tactics.
Brand Identity
You may want to create a brand identity as part of your strategy. Brand positioning, voice, and visual identity may also be helpful additions to your marketing strategy.
Marketing Plan and Tactics
Your marketing plan is the specific actions you’ll take to achieve the goals in your marketing strategy. Your plan may cover campaigns, channel-specific tactics, and more.

Budget Allocation
Defining a budget for your marketing strategy helps you show that your planned resource allocation aligns with business goals.
I think it’s important to get clear about your spending and how your proposed budget will impact the company’s overall business goals.
Timeline and Milestones
Marketing strategies can be complex and difficult for stakeholders to understand. Creating a timeline that outlines the different tactics, milestones, and deadlines can help.
Your marketing strategy is a living document. It will need constant reviews, revisions, and optimizations to meet your long-term goals. Prepare to revise your marketing strategy at least once a year to address market trends, customer feedback, and changing business objectives.

Examples of Successful Marketing Strategies
1. Regal Movies
Digital Strategy: Owned Media
Regal shares interactive Instagram content that’s not only relevant to its film-loving customers but also encourages them to interact with the content.

Source
Regal’s Instagram post is an example of owned media because the company was in full control of the answers it shared with its followers. Interacting in the comment section was an opportunity for Regal to showcase its voice and brand to its audience.
And it clearly worked well. The post received half as many comments as it did likes, with an impressive 207 comments.
Best for: I think social media is a great owned channel to experiment with new ideas for your overall marketing strategy.
2. La Croix
Digital Strategy: User-Generated Content, Earned Media
I think user-generated content is one of the best ways to gain traction in your strategy.
It demonstrates your appreciation for loyal customers, builds community, and incentivizes other users to promote your products for the chance at a similar shout-out.
Plus, sometimes the content your brand loyalists create is really, really good. In this case, the consumer is creating a handmade needlepoint featuring the brand’s product.

Source
Pro tip: UGC isn’t reserved for consumer brands with visual products to share. B2B companies can also take advantage of UGC by sharing positive reviews of their product and incorporating them into their messaging.
3. Small Girls PR
Digital Strategy: Owned Media

Source
Small Girls PR is a boutique PR company based in New York, and one of the company’s talents is connecting with amazing clients. This post on Instagram is an effective marketing example, as it boosts awareness for their brand and offers social proof by featuring high-profile clients.
Pro tip: I find that owned media in the form of PR is a great way to spotlight company executives and position them as industry leaders.
4. Tobii
Digital Strategy: Paid Media
Eye-tracking software company Tobii launched a LinkedIn ad to promote a lead magnet. While the brand may have created the guide specifically for paid promotions, it’s also possible that they repurposed a high-performing blog post into a downloadable PDF.

Source
In this case, all they had to do was repackage their current content, build an ad around it with creative assets, and run it.
What I like: In previous sections, I discussed the power of leveraging multiple forms of media in your marketing strategy. This is a great example of it.
5. Target
Digital Strategy: Owned Media, Influencer Partnership
If you’ve got the time for influencer partnerships, I encourage you to take full advantage of it.
Influencer marketing is when you partner with influencers to promote your content on their site. By doing this, your content reaches new audiences you might not be able to reach organically:

Source
Target recently partnered with fashion expert and influencer Jeneé Naylor to collaborate on its Future Collective line. What made this campaign even more powerful was that Naylor was a former Target Team Member.
I love how this collaboration highlighted Target’s commitment to supporting its team members and influencer marketing strategy.
Best for: Consumer, lifestyle, and retail brands. While just 24% of marketers use influencer marketing, marketers report that it has a high ROI. The channels with the best ROI for influencer marketing are Facebook (28%), Instagram (22%), and YouTube (12%).

Best Marketing Tools to Execute Your Strategy
While a marketing strategy is essential to reach your goals, that’s just step one. You need a robust tech stack to plan, manage, and execute your marketing strategy. Tools can make or break your marketing efforts. Just over half of marketers without a CRM, for example, felt their marketing strategy was effective compared with 87% of those using HubSpot.

Source
Here, I’ve curated a list of marketing and management tools to help you track and measure the success of your marketing goals.
1. HubSpot Marketing Hub
HubSpot’s Marketing Hub allows you to connect all your marketing tools into one centralized platform, including social media, content marketing, and email marketing.

HubSpot avoids the complexity and headaches of legacy CRM tools. With this tool, you can attract users with blogs, SEO, and live chat tools. You can then convert and nurture those leads through marketing automation, the website and landing page builder, and lead tracking features.
With custom reporting and built-in analytics, you can analyze your data and plan your next move.
HubSpot’s Breeze AI features bring generative AI to your fingertips so you can create great content, automate workflows, and built campaigns with AI-powered intelligence.
What I like: HubSpot Marketing Hub integrates with over 800 tools, making it easy to create a tech stack that meets your specific business needs.
Pricing: Free plans are available; Starter - $15/month; Professional - $800/month; Enterprise - $3,600/month.
2. Trello

Source
Trello keeps your marketing team on track and openly communicates about the projects you’re working on. You can create boards for individual campaigns, editorial calendars, or quarterly goals.
Built-in workflows and automation capabilities keep communication streamlined, and simplicity keeps your marketing team focused on the work that matters.
What I like: Trello’s visual elements and straightforward organization make it easy for everyone to stay on the same page.
Pricing: Free plans available; Standard - $5/month; Premium - $10/month; Enterprise - $17.50/month for 250 users.
3. TrueNorth

Source
TrueNorth is a marketing management platform built to help you hit your marketing goals. Built specifically for marketing teams, TrueNorth turns your marketing strategy into a visual projection of your growth, which is used to create monthly milestones that help you stay on track.
What I like: TrueNorth centralizes all your ideas, campaigns, and results in one place, with everything tied back to your goal.
Pricing: Plans cost $99/month, with a free 14-day trial available.
4. Monday.com

Source
Everything on Monday.com starts with a board or visually driven table. Create and customize workflows for your team and keep groups, items, sub-items, and updates synced in real time.
You can also transform data pulled from the timeline and use Gantt views to track your projects on Monday.com to make sure you’re meeting your deadlines.
Plus, with more than 40 integrations — from SurveyMonkey to Mailchimp and, of course, HubSpot — you can visualize your data and make sure your whole company is collaborating.
Best for: Companies with locations around the world or lots of remote workers, as it keeps everyone in touch and up to speed no matter where they’re located.
Pricing: Monday.com is free for two seats; $9/month/seat or $90/month for 10 seats; Standard - $12/month/seat or $120/month for 10 seats; Pro - $19/seat/month or $190 per month for 10 seats. Contact Monday.com for Enterprise pricing.
5. Semrush

Source
SEO continues to be a huge factor in the successful ranking of your website. But you need the right tools to do it successfully.
Semrush allows you to run a technical SEO audit, track daily rankings, analyze your competitors’ SEO strategy, research millions of keywords, and even source ideas for earning more organic traffic.
But the benefits don’t stop at SEO. I like that you can also use SemRush for PPC, building and measuring an effective social media strategy, content planning, and even market research.
Best for: Creating, implementing, and tracking your marketing strategy.
Pricing: Pro - $139.95/month; Guru - $249.95/month; Business - $499.95/month.
6. Buzzsumo

Source
BuzzSumo allows you to analyze data to enhance and lead your marketing strategy, all while exploring high-performing content in your industry.
Use the platform to find influencers who may help your brand reach, track comments, and find trends to make the most of every turn.
What I like: As your needs evolve, you can also use their crisis management and video marketing tools.
Pricing: Content creation plan - $199/month; PR & Comms plan - $299/month; Suite plan - $499/month; Enterprise plan - $999/month.
7. Crazy Egg
Need to optimize your website?

Source
I highly recommend getting started with Crazy Egg. You’ll be able to identify “attention hotspots” on your product pages, track ad campaign traffic on your site, and understand if shoppers are clicking where you want them to.
You can even make sure your “Buy Now” buttons are in the best place.
Crazy Egg also offers recordings, A/B testing, and more to help make sure your website is offering the best user experience.
Best for: If your marketing strategy includes optimizing your website, Crazy Egg is the tool for you.
Pricing: Starter - $29/month; Plus - $99/month; Pro - $249/month; Enterprise - $499/month.

Get Started Creating an Effective Marketing Strategy
Ultimately, creating a complete marketing strategy isn’t something that can happen overnight. It takes time, hard work, and dedication to confirm you’re reaching your ideal audience— whenever and wherever they want to be reached.
Stick with it (and use some of the resources I’ve included in this post), and over time, research and customer feedback will help you refine your strategy to make sure you’re spending most of your time on the marketing channels your audience cares most about.

Summarize Summary SEO copywriting is creating high-quality content that appeals to search engine algorithms and human users. It also "sells" your product or service.Here's the SEO copywriting process in a nutshell:Research. Find what people are searching for, understand their intent, write an outline, and add a unique spin.Draft. Hook readers with a compelling intro, keep them engaged throughout and answer their questions with an FAQ section.Edit. Use simple language and optimize for featured snippets.You can also include a table of contents and write compelling title tags to take things to the next level.This summary is not a substitute for reading the article in full, as you may miss out on important nuances.Combining SEO and copywriting techniques can help you rank high on Google and other search engines, and drive sales too.In this post, you’ll learn what SEO copywriting is and how to do it.ContentsWhat is SEO copywriting?SEO copywriting is creating high-quality content that appeals to both search engine algorithms and human users. It’s writing content that’s designed to rank high on Google and, at the same time, content that people want to consume, link to, and share on social media.Why is SEO copywriting important?Content that ranks and gets tons of search traffic but doesn’t move business goals is pointless. Likewise for compelling content that gets no traffic.But if you can successfully blend solid SEO fundamentals and good copywriting techniques together, you can create valuable content that ranks high on search engines and entice users to consume, share, and even purchase. This is exactly how we’ve grown Ahrefs to 2.4 million monthly search visits while generating an eight-figure annual recurring revenue (ARR). It’s the core of our SEO content strategy.How to do SEO copywritingThere are three stages in SEO copywriting:Stage 1. ResearchThis stage’s about planning what to write. Here are some SEO copywriting tips:1. Start with keyword researchIf you want search traffic, you have to write about topics that your target audience search for. So before you put pen to paper, you need to have a list of relevant keywords to target.The easiest way to do this is to use a keyword research tool. Here’s how:Go to Ahrefs’ Keywords ExplorerEnter specific keywords relevant to your siteGo to the Matching terms reportGo through the list and look for relevant keywords you could cover. For example, this keyword would be perfect for a mattress company:Further readingKeyword Research: The Beginner’s Guide by Ahrefs 2. Match search intentGoogle only wants to rank relevant content. And most people are usually looking for one of these types of content when they search Google:Blog postVideoProduct pageCategory pageToolSo if you want to stand the best chance of ranking high in search engines, you need to align with search intent.You can find this out by looking at the top-ranking pages.For example, if we look at the SERP overview for “how to sleep better,” we can see it’s mostly list-based blog posts:That’s what we have to create if we’re targeting this search term.Further readingWhat Is Search Intent? A Complete Guide for Beginners 3. Create a data-driven outlineEvery topic naturally generates subtopics. The more relevant subtopics you cover, the more likely you’ll rank for more keywords and get more traffic.You can find these subtopics by looking at the common keyword rankings among the top-ranking pages. This is also a good way to build your blog post outline.Here’s how to find these subtopics:Go to Ahrefs’ Keywords ExplorerEnter your target keywordScroll to the SERP overviewCheck a few of the top-ranking pagesClick Open in and choose Content gapThis opens up the Content Gap report, where you’ll see the common keyword rankings among these pages. Look through the results to see if there are any subtopics you can cover.For example, if we’re creating content for the topic “how to sleep better,” these may make good H2s:How many hours of sleep do you needSleep hygieneSleep hours by ageHow to get deep sleepTips for falling asleep4. Make your content stand out by giving it a unique spinLinks are an important Google ranking factor. If your content is like everyone else’s, then there’s no reason for anyone to link to you instead of others.SEO copywriting is a balance between giving searchers what they want and saying something unique and original. One way to add a unique spin is to write from personal experience. Searchers want real-world, tried and tested tips and advice, not generic ones. Google understands that too. That’s why it introduced E-E-A-T, where the first “E” stands for experience. So if you want to give sleep tips, try them out first before writing about them. For example, when I wrote about being a content creator, I wrote it from my experience.5. Get to the point with the “inverted pyramid” methodSome people just want to know what the best non-stick pan is. So Wirecutter gives it to them:For everyone else, there is more context ahead.This format is known as the inverted pyramid, where you give the essential before the rest:From an SEO perspective, giving readers what they want immediately may help reduce pogo-sticking and improve dwell time.For example, I defined “digital content creation” immediately in my post:6. Establish proof and credibilityGoogle knows that people want to learn how to lift from a personal trainer, not a random dude from the streets. That’s why Google introduced E-E-A-T, with the second “E” standing for expertise. While not direct ranking factors, Google’s human quality raters use them to assess the quality of search results.So the important thing is to establish proof that you know what you’re saying. For example, Wirecutter’s articles include a section on “Why you should trust me”:If you do not have the required expertise for your target keyword, interview someone who does. That’s what we did when we wrote a blog post about Google penalties:Here’s how to find experts if you’re not sure who to reach out to:Go to Ahrefs’ Content ExplorerEnter your target keywordGo to the “Authors” tabThis will show you a list of authors who’ve published content about the topic.Stage 2. DraftingThis stage’s about putting fingers to keyboard and getting the words out. In short: Start writing. Every writer will have their own style, but SEO copywriters usually have the same goals: create high-quality content that educates, entertains, and delights readers while leading them closer to conversion.Here are a few SEO copywriting tips you can use:7. Hook readers in with the PAS formulaYour intro needs to hook readers in and get them interested in reading the rest. You can do this with the Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) formula.First, you define the problem:Then, you agitate it:Finally, reveal the solution:8. Use “bucket brigades” to keep readers readingBucket brigades are transitional words and phrases that encourage readers to keep on reading. They leverage curiosity by intentionally leaving things unresolved.Here are examples from my own writing:Check out this post for more bucket brigade examples to use.9. Make your content even more helpful by adding an FAQ sectionPeople naturally get more curious as they research a topic. They may have tons of related questions. But it can be difficult to answer all of them without breaking the flow of your article.To solve this, create an FAQ section. Answering popular questions on your page can help you rank higher for long-tail keywords. For example, that’s what we did in our post on H1 tags:Because we answered a common question, we now rank on Google when people are searching for this answer:Here’s how to find frequently asked questions to answer:Go to Keywords ExplorerEnter your topicGo to the Matching terms reportToggle to “Questions”Stage 3. EditingThe final stage is about improving your draft and making sure what you’ve written is what you want to say.Here are some tips:10. Optimize for featured snippetsFeatured snippets are quick answers in search results that Google pulls from a page ranking in the top 10.You can shortcut your way to the top if you “capture” the featured snippet. So plan for it by checking if a featured snippet exists for your main keyword—and what is required to win it. For example, if we search for “marketing funnel,” we see that Google shows a definition:If we want to capture this, we’ll have to include a definition, which we did:11. Write how you speakNothing screams “stop reading” more than dry copy, corporate speak, and meaningless jargon. Complex language alienates readers and drives them back to the SERPs.Good web copy is casual. So imagine that you’re conversing with a friend over the web. If you’re worried your SEO copy sounds too uppity, paste it into Hemingway:It’ll give you a readability score and suggestions on how to improve.12. Make reading easy by editing with the ASMR formulaReading is a transaction. Your readers are trading their time for your words. If it’s a chore to read, they’ll hit the “back” button. So make sure your content is comfortable to read. You can do so by following the ASMR formula.First, add annotations. Including elements like sidenotes, quotes, and social media embeds can break up the monotony:Next, use short sentences and paragraphs. Break up long sentences with transitional words (e.g., “and,” “that”) into short sentences instead.Third, include multimedia. Inserting videos, images, and GIFs can illustrate your points without adding extra words—like this flowchart:Finally, read your copy out loud. This pinpoints areas where your content doesn’t flow smoothly.Bonus SEO copywriting tipsThese extra SEO copywriting tips can help elevate your content.13. Include a table of contentsYour reader wants to know if your content fulfills what they’re looking for. You can help them do that by adding a table of contents (ToC):This allows them to navigate to their desired section. Once they’ve started reading, they may be sucked into your copy and read the rest of your content.Adding a ToC may also create sitelinks for your page, which Google sometimes shows in the search engine results:This can potentially lead to more clicks.14. Get more clicks by crafting compelling title tagsThe title tag is one of the first things a searcher will see. So it needs to compel them to click.The easiest way to create enticing title tags is to use our free title tag generator. Add a prompt, choose a tone, and click “Generate Title”:You’ll get a title tag suggestion, which you can improve:Further readingHow to Craft the Perfect SEO Title Tag (Our 4-Step Process) SEO copywriting toolsTools are your friends in SEO copywriting.

Copywriting is using words to persuade someone to take action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter.Final thoughtsContent writers and content marketers, take note: SEO isn’t only about better rankings on Google. It’s also about getting your readers to read, share, and link to you. That’s why SEO copywriting is important.

PrefaceBefore we get too far in, I‚Äôd love to start things off with a few quick notes:1. This is a long article.Feel free to bookmark or send to Pocket to set aside some time to hash through this.2. Content marketing strategies aren‚Äôt easy to write.We‚Äôre going to dig into big strategies like website crawls and persona profiles and thematic taxonomies and competitive analyses. (I had to learn a good deal of stuff I was unfamiliar with in order to start writing these, too!) At each step, I‚Äôve included some recommended material for further reading.3. This isn‚Äôt gospel.Like the pirate code, these are more guidelines than actual rules. =) You‚Äôll find that some projects need more in-depth planning than others.4. Stay flexible.A strong content marketing strategy should give you focus, not lock you into less-than-awesome ideas! The key to a great content marketing strategy is being able to tweak, break, and chuck parts of it as you learn more about what works and what doesn‚Äôt.All right, now that we‚Äôve covered the caveats, let‚Äôs look at how to write this content marketing strategy!

‚Äî

How to write a content marketing strategy step-by-stepLet‚Äôs walk though how you can write a content marketing strategy‚Äîone that pulls together all the pieces and gives you a clear plan for moving forward.

‚Äî

Step 1: Start with an outlineWriting a strategy can sound like a daunting task. How detailed should it be? How high-level should it be? Starting with an outline can help you conceptualize all the ground you need to cover‚Äîand it may save you from expending your energy covering unnecessary ground!And what is the right ground to cover anyway?A good content marketing strategy will answer three basic questions:Why are we making content in the first place?What content do we need?How do we get that content to accomplish our goals?Your outline will help you structure your research and ideation so that you‚Äôre focused on answering these key questions.For example, one way this could look is by splitting the remaining steps below (all 20 of ‚Äôem) into each of these buckets. The outline, then, could look a little something like this:For the rest of these steps, I‚Äôm going to work through a basic outline template that has helped me in both in-house and agency roles. (And I‚Äôd be more than happy to give you a copy of this outline to copy or tweak!)Once you‚Äôve got an outline, it‚Äôs time to start with what you know: yourself.

‚Äî

Step 2: Write down what you‚Äôre trying to accomplishThis is where you‚Äôll write out your content marketing goals. What are you trying to accomplish? It helps if this is specific, because later on in this process, you will be comparing your content to your goals to see what‚Äôs truly in alignment.This may express itself as a big objective with smaller SMART goals folded underneath (SMART stands for ‚ÄúSpecific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely‚Äù).An example may be:Goal: To become perceived as a thought leader on the phenomenon of Roomba rodeos.Objective #1: Generate $500,000 in revenue from online training courses by December 31, 2016.Objective #2: Rank on the first page of Google search engine results for ‚ÄúRoomba rodeo‚Äù by April 1, 2016.Objective #3: Grow an email list of 5,000 unique double opt-in subscribers by March 4, 2016.Note: A great question to ask for added context might be: What are the overall marketing goals, and how can content marketing support them? I‚Äôve found that some organizations group content marketing into a separate team (or outsource the efforts), which means it may be wise to get some advice from other non‚Äìcontent marketing folks in your organization.(Protip: sometimes asking other teams and departments for content input is a great way to build a culture of content in your organization!)Once you‚Äôve written down these goals, you can ask yourself (and your team) a few questions:How does good content accomplish these goals?How can we measure whether or not our content is aligned with these goals?This is where you‚Äôll outline your content KPIs (key performance indicators).For more thoughts on setting marketing goals, check out this best-of list of methods from experts like Noah Kagan, Ryan Holiday, Rand Fishkin, our own Courtney Seiter. You might also want to swipe some goal-setting templates from HubSpot‚Äôs Mike Lemire.

‚Äî

Step 3 (optional): Write down what you‚Äôre sellingI‚Äôve found it helpful to write out what the product or service I‚Äôm trying to sell is. It helps me think through the features, the different product tiers, the sales cycle, etc. When you know what you‚Äôre selling, you can more easily frame the kind of content you will need to sell it.Of course, you may be the product creator, the marketer, the one-human show, and this might not be something you need to write down. If not, feel free to skip this part.

‚Äî

Step 4: Now, who‚Äôs going to consume your content?It‚Äôs time to outline who the audience for your content marketing efforts is going to be. If you‚Äôve done some of your persona research already, huzzah! You can plug those little blocks of fictional, alliterative goodness here.Don‚Äôt have your buyer personas fleshed out yet? Now‚Äôs a terrific time to get started on this! Here are a few resources to help you start developing your own personas:HubSpot‚Äôs classic persona templateIf you‚Äôre launching a new brand, check out Wideo CEO Agu De Marco‚Äôs guide to creating personasIf you already have a customer base, Qualaroo‚Äôs smart surveys can help you group them into personas

‚Äî

Step 5: Map your personas‚Äô needs to your product or serviceJay Acunzo wrote my very favorite definition of content marketing:Solving the same problem or conveying the same emotion as your product, using media you create and distribute.Once you‚Äôve looked at who your audience is, you need to ask one crucial question: How can you help them?This question is the heart and soul of content marketing. Your whole content marketing plan will benefit from writing this out.The key to this step is to map your persona‚Äôs pain points, goals, and desires to the solutions you want to sell. This might look like making a table with brief descriptions of each. Or it might be something you‚Äôd like to write out in story form‚Äîsomething Moz‚Äôs Isla McKetta has some super helpful thoughts on!Again, this step is key, because the rest of this strategy is going to be about creating and upgrading and curating and promoting content that solves the same problems your product solves!

Step 6 (optional): Heroes and watering holesYou‚Äôre laying a terrific foundation for your content strategy. You‚Äôve dug through your personas‚Äô deepest wants and needs and mapped those to your product. You‚Äôre getting an idea of what kinds of problems your content needs to solve. Things are starting to take shape.There‚Äôs another (optional) thing I like to look at before leaving the audience section of the content marketing plan, though. I like to know:Where is my audience already going for this kind of information?This is a fun exercise I‚Äôve nicknamed ‚Äúheroes and watering holes.‚Äù (You can probably come up with a better name for it!) I call them that because at this stage in the content marketing plan, it‚Äôs good to start thinking of the sources of information the audience already trusts. Those sources generally fall into two groups:Heroes are those celebrity thought-leaders who have followings around their personal brands. These are the names that jump to mind when you think of the experts in your industry. An example of one of my heroes is Bryan Harris, whose intensely practical case studies give me and other marketers so much to riff off in our own efforts.Watering holes are those sources of information that aren‚Äôt necessarily tied to a person. They represent places your customers trust for awesome content. Examples of watering holes for me are Inbound.org or Quora, where I know there‚Äôs always going to be more interesting information that will help me do my job better.If you examine where your audience is already going for information, you can get a more comprehensive view of the content marketplace. It can help protect you from trying to reinvent any content wheels, and it can give you some awesome ideas for guest posting‚Äîthe lifeblood of the early content marketing strategy at Buffer!Unless you have a really wide reach, you can probably use your own intuition to map out your audience‚Äôs influencers. But if you‚Äôd like a more data-driven approach, you may want to use tools like FollowerWonk and BuzzSumo.

‚Äî

Step 7: Look to the competition‚Äôs content marketing efforts for inspirationIt‚Äôs good to know what kind of content your audience wants.It‚Äôs fantastic to know what kind of content your competitors are already giving them.You don‚Äôt need to do a deep-dive competitive analysis for every single content marketing plan you write, but you will probably find it helpful to take a moment to reflect on just what other people and brands are offering your personas.By the way, when you think about competition in terms of content marketing, it can work a little differently than you might imagine. Your competitors aren‚Äôt necessarily the organizations that are competing for customer dollars. When it comes to content marketing, your competitors are the people and organizations that are competing for your audience‚Äôs attention.This is generally a good place in your content strategy to ask a few questions:Who is competing for my personas‚Äô business? These are your direct competitors.Who is competing for my personas‚Äô attention, but not necessarily their business? These are your indirectHow can my brand stand out?It‚Äôs helpful to think through the ways that your content can uniquely appeal to your personas. Will you offer more long-form, deep tactical content? Will your content be more visually oriented? Will your content be crafted with a distinctively delightful tone?This graphic from Garrett Moon of CoSchedule does a great job explaining this concept (the blue ocean blogs are what you‚Äôd aim for):This piece of the strategy will help you orient yourself in the content marketplace, so that you, your team, and/or your client can create content marketing pieces that stand out rather than blend in.Not sure who your competitors are?There are a few ways to find out.One of my favorites: SEMRush. They show you which websites are ranking for the same keywords in search engines as you‚Äîwhich is super helpful! At a glance, you can see who else is getting organic and paid search engine attention for the keywords you might be targeting.

‚Äî

Step 8: Take inventory of your contentOK, this step could be its own blog post. Or blog series. Or book. Or director‚Äôs edition extended cut DVD set.You get the idea: taking inventory of your marketing content is no small task.Let‚Äôs get a high-level view of what this could look like, and then I‚Äôll be happy to share some links for further reading.When you take inventory of your content, you get a list of all your content marketing assets (both onsite and offsite).This could be as general as a list of channels. For example, if Buffer were to do a high-level content inventory without digging into the details, it might look like this:OnsiteBuffer.com informational pagesBuffer.com landing pagesSocial blogOpen blogOverflow blogOffsiteSocial media accountsMailChimp listsGuest postsSyndication relationshipsEven something as simple as this is helpful‚Äîbut only to the extent of figuring out where all your content might be.The deeper dive into these individual content marketing assets (a fantastic exercise if you‚Äôre up for it) would include:getting a list of all the keywords you rank for in search engines,all the blog posts getting significant traffic and conversions,all the active email lists,all the live high-level web pages,all your social media accounts . . .everything.It‚Äôs a great deal of work. But you emerge from it being incredibly well-attuned to the state of content marketing for your brand.In short, what we‚Äôre looking at here is a content audit.And how do you do a content audit? There are many, many tools and blog posts that can help you do this, but here are a few that I‚Äôve personally found invaluable.This post from Portent Inc. CEO Ian Lurie is the end-all guide to writing one of these. Well done, Ian!Screaming Frog is a super useful tool for taking inventory of all the pages on your site.Google Webmaster Tools, Moz, and SEMRush are helpful for taking inventory of the keywords your content ranks for.But what about the social media offsite content? We can help you with that: Buffer for Business analytics show you what kind of traction your social accounts are gaining, and what kind of posts are driving said traction. =)

‚Äî

Step 9: Evaluate your existing contentNow that you‚Äôve put together a list of your content marketing assets, it‚Äôs time to line them up against those objectives we covered at the beginning of this plan.The central question we‚Äôre trying to answer: Which pieces of content are aligned with our objectives?(With a follow-up: Which pieces of content can we reorient to align with our objectives?)One approach I find super helpful here is to map out the most important pieces of content from the inventory on a matrix like the one below.The X axis plots performance: that‚Äôs metrics like pageviews, likes, shares, comments, and rankings. The Y axis plots alignment, which is a little fuzzier. The higher up a piece of content is, the more in alignment with our brand‚Äôs goals and ethos it is.When looking at the content you‚Äôve inventoried, which content falls into which quadrants? (You could assign a quadrant value to each type of content if you like, but unless you‚Äôre dealing with a hefty budget, your intuition will work just fine.)Some resources that help with evaluating content performance:Google Analytics measures traffic and conversions.Buzzsumo measures your content‚Äôs spread via major social media networks.Moz and Ahrefs tell you which content is pulling in those epic backlinks.Google Webmaster Tools, Moz, and SEMRush tell you which pages are ranking for search terms.Buffer for Business is my favorite tool for measuring social media channels.Your users¬≠‚Äîit‚Äôs easy (for me!) to get stuck in the quantitative performance metrics, but it‚Äôs also good to keep in mind what your audience is telling you they like best.When you‚Äôve finished this, it‚Äôs time to ask four important questions:What sticks?What should we fix?What should we nix?What should we add to the mix?What sticks? (Step 10)This speaks to that sweet, sweet top-right corner of the matrix, where your content is aligned with your brand and acing performance. One thing I find helpful in a content strategy is to list out the content assets that are already performing well at this point.What should we fix? (Step 11)There will probably be bits of content in quadrants 1 and 4 that could get bumped into quadrant 4 with a little love and care. Make a list of the pieces that really have potential to turn into high-value content marketing assets, along with the ways in which they could be improved.For example, you may notice that your ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù infographics are generating some super positive comments, but they‚Äôre not getting very many shares or backlinks. You might want to take note of this, as this will be worked into the content strategy later.What should we nix? (Step 12)Where‚Äôs the dead weight? There may be some content in quadrant 3 that‚Äôs just not doing you any favors. No backlinks, no likes, no rankings‚Äîit‚Äôs just clutter. (This may also include totally outdated content.)If it‚Äôs no good, don‚Äôt be afraid to put it on the list to be nixed. It‚Äôll clear up space and help you focus on the content that‚Äôs most important.What do we add to the mix? (Step 13)And here‚Äôs where your content marketing strategy begins to take on that epic creative element! After meticulously combing over your content, what ideas do you get for new content? What assets could be driving business objectives? What has your brand overlooked? What have you always wanted to try?(This is probably my favorite part of writing content marketing strategies!)

‚Äî

Step 14 (optional): Sort your effective and prospective content marketing assets by themeYou‚Äôve audited all your content.Huzzah!We‚Äôre about to move into the part of the strategy that deals with making this content, but first, let‚Äôs pull some of this audit together by identifying some major content themes. This will play a big part in mapping out a content production and promotion schedule soon.Look at the content that sticks.What categories or topics are really resonating with your readers?Look at your personas‚Äîwhy would they favor those topics?By asking these questions, we can start building out content themes: these are the broad umbrella topics that your best content tends to group under. This is the time in the content marketing strategizing stage where I find it helpful to write these down. Doing so helps hone the plan for producing new content around these themes‚Äîwhich makes things a lot simpler for the folks writing, designing, and coding the content!

‚Äî

Step 15: Refill your coffeeI hope you will have done so long before reaching this step, but I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder. ?Step 15 (for serious): List the types of content you‚Äôll be dealing withYou‚Äôve completed a huge component of this strategy piece: you‚Äôve combed through all your content and channels to find what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not, and what you‚Äôd like to create.Well done. Very well done!Now we need to start making a plan for producing content. Just for reference, ‚Äúproducing content‚Äù covers two general areas of content crafting:Optimizing, updating, or otherwise fine-tuning the content that you identified in Step 11 (content to fix).Creating the content you listed in Step 13 (content to add to the mix).We‚Äôll start by listing out the kind of work this will involve, namely, the types of content that need to be crafted. This might include:Long-form, SEO-driven blog postsInterviewsEbooksInfographicsEmail coursesExplainer videosOnce you have a list of the kinds of content you‚Äôre dealing with, you may want to give each one a brief description. For example, you could write:Long-form, SEO-driven blog posts. Posts targeting specific search concepts, usually 2,200+ words in length, written to gain backlinks, comments, and organic search.Ebooks. Documents expounding on a specific topic, usually 5,000+ words, delivered as PDFs, written to give away as lead-generation pieces.This is key, because in the next steps, you‚Äôll outline how these kinds of content will be made.Step 16: Snapshot the content team and workflowOne trap that I often fall into is underestimating how long it will take to create a piece of content. (Confession: I‚Äôm finishing this post two days later than I originally planned on it being done!) That‚Äôs why, when laying out a content strategy, it‚Äôs good to get an idea of who‚Äôs working on the content, and how that content is going to be created. The goal: get an idea of how much content you have capacity for.It may help to focus on answering two key questions here:Who‚Äôs the team?What‚Äôs the workflow?For the team, you can list your in-house content creators, as well as any contractors you plan to work with.For the workflow, this is a simple step-by-step breakdown of the content creation/fixing process. It could look like, ‚ÄúIdeate > Write > Design > Edit > Schedule > Promote,‚Äù or it could be more involved than this.This is a tricky one, especially if you‚Äôre proposing the first content marketing strategy for an organization. You face a host of unknowns. How long will it take to hire content specialists? How much will it cost to get a designer to make your infographics? How successful will content promotion efforts be?The good news: You don‚Äôt need to have all the answers here. In fact, sometimes this exercise is most helpful at identifying the elements of content creation that we haven‚Äôt figured out yet! What‚Äôs important is that you have some idea of where this content marketing effort is coming from. Refining this piece is an ongoing process. =)

‚Äî

Step 17: Estimate your content capacityOnce you‚Äôve outlined everything you can in the previous step, it‚Äôs time to estimate just how much content can be created in the next span of time.If you‚Äôre outsourcing this part to a team of experienced content marketers, content production might follow a reliable timetable. But if your team is just getting into content marketing, this can be a tough one. This is where it helps to ask for advice from people with experience.And if you can‚Äôt know for sure, guess.The key here is to find a level of content production your team is confident they can take on, and then go for it. If you end up with lots of unfinished tasks at the end of the month, you can adjust expectations. If you finish way ahead of time, you can either ramp up production or invest in even higher-quality content.Either way, you want to have an idea of how much content you can make.Pro-tip: a spreadsheet may come in handy here! You can create columns for content type, estimated hours, quantity of pieces, and finally a total. This can help you build a few possible breakdowns of your content capacity.

‚Äî

Step 18: Map out your editorial calendarYou know what content you‚Äôre going to make.You know how you‚Äôre going to make it, and you have an idea of how long it‚Äôs going to take.Now, when will you publish it?It‚Äôs time to map out your editorial calendar for your content marketing assets. This is where you plot your blog posts, emails, ebooks, podcasts, etc. across a given patch of time, be it months, quarters, or semesters.(You could go longer, but I‚Äôve found it helpful to keep the scope of time small enough for you to stay flexible and pivot based on what kind of content is performing.)One thing to keep in mind: you don‚Äôt necessarily need to plan out every single piece of individual content on this calendar from the get-go. But it will help to map out how those content themes from Step 14 and the content types you listed in Step 16 will be spread across the next time period.Protip: It‚Äôs easy to forget social media posting schedules here (since blogging and email take up a decent amount of brainspace). You may want to map out some of your social content schedule on the editorial calendar. Your social media conversations will understandably be more fluid than blog posts or emails, so this doesn‚Äôt need to be the end-all social media schedule. It‚Äôs just something to consider, as you may find it helpful just so you can see it in context of the rest of your content production. =)One more protip: This is a great place to include your guest blogging and syndication efforts, too!A few tools to consider for your editorial calendar:Create a Google calendar and share it with your content team.Create a Trello board for your editorial pieces and enable the Calendar view Powerup. (This is what we‚Äôre using for the Buffer Social blog!)

‚Äî

Step 19: Make a content promotion workflowIf you publish a blog post in a forest, but nobody is around to read it, does it make a sound? ?Probably not.Creating amazing content is incredibly important, but there‚Äôs SO MUCH content being made every day! You‚Äôre going to need to find a way to get your awesome blog posts and infographics and podcasts in front of the right eyeballs.You don‚Äôt just want a plan for making content. You want a plan for driving attention to it.This is a great time in the content marketing plan building process to map that out. How will you drive traffic to your content?You can start with a very simple process for doing so. It could be as straightforward as this:Publish contentEmail co-workers to let them know about it, ask them to share (My teammate Kevan has some awesome thoughts on how this can work!)Share it to corporate social accountsSend a note to email subscribers about itEmail influencers to let them know about it (backlinks!)Write guest posts linking back to that postFull disclosure: that‚Äôs not a complete list of things you can do, by any means‚Äîespecially that last item. You‚Äôll want to promote your content through those heroes and watering holes you described at the beginning of this strategy, and you‚Äôll want to do it in a way that makes them look forward to getting more content from you.There‚Äôs a lot that can be said when it comes to figuring out a content promotion workflow. For now, it‚Äôs important that you have some means of driving traffic to your content once it‚Äôs published.For more on content promotion plans and tactics, go read anything (or everything!) by Brian Dean. I‚Äôve found this video and this guide to be especially insightful.And here‚Äôs a peek at the content distribution checklist used at Buffer:

‚Äî

Step 20: Write the epilogueSum up your content strategy by painting an awesome picture of what it will be like if you execute on it. You can put lots of interesting things here, including experiments you hope to learn from and awesome blogs your content might be featured on.But, of course, the most important thing to do is briefly wrap up your strategy by relating it to those business objectives you listed at the very beginning. =)

‚Äî

Step 21: Write the executive summaryYou‚Äôve done it.You have put together the epic content marketing strategy. You might be sitting on top of a 20-page document. Heck, if you‚Äôre working with a really big organization, it could be pushing 50 pages. You have just made yourself the ultimate expert on your content.Your boss or client is going to be totally floored by the amount of time and research and thought you just put into this.And they won‚Äôt have time to read it. =)That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll want to circle back around and add an executive summary to the beginning of your content strategy. Think of it as a TL;DR that answers four basic questions:What are you aiming to accomplish?What‚Äôs the state of content right now?What needs to change?How will you make it happen?Ka-BAM!You‚Äôre done. =DDownload this content marketing strategy template for yourself!If you‚Äôd like to use this method as a foundation for your next content marketing strategy, you‚Äôre totally welcome to grab the template!

This guide covers the basics of Facebook Ads, including how to define your audiences, set up the Meta pixel, and kick off your first ad campaign.

7 tasks to start Facebook advertising
Here are seven things to do when setting up Facebook advertising for your business. Each step includes helpful resources to guide you through the process.

Get to know the Meta Business Suite
Install the Meta pixel
Create Facebook audiences
Retarget your website visitors
Try different Facebook ad types
Stick to Facebook‚Äôs ad specifications
Budget for Facebook ad costs

1. Get to know the Meta Business Suite
With its data dashboards, multiple ad formats, and audience insight tools, opening Meta‚Äôs business tool for the first time can be a little overwhelming. 
Luckily, creating Facebook ads is not as complicated as it seems. Your Meta Business Suite is the section of Facebook that houses your Facebook ad account, business pages, and other tools you‚Äôll need to run ads.
If you haven‚Äôt created a Facebook page for your business, you‚Äôll need to do this before you can access Business Suite features such as the Ads Manager.
Ads Manager is Meta‚Äôs platform for running ads across Facebook and Instagram. With Ads Manager, you can set up campaigns, choose your audience, upload ad creatives, and adjust ad settings to maximize performance.
Next, get to know how Meta Ads Manager works.
2. Install the Meta pixel
A common frustration among Facebook advertisers is understanding whether their ads actually work. The Meta pixel is an analytics tool that helps you measure how effective your Facebook ad campaigns are, by monitoring the actions people take on your website. Pixels track your website events like page views and purchases, then connect them with Facebook users.
The Meta pixel needs to be placed in the head section of your website‚Äôs index page, so that it appears on every page of your website. Once it‚Äôs there, you‚Äôll be able to create retargeting ad campaigns for people who have already visited your website.
Next, learn how to set up a Meta pixel on your website.
3. Create Facebook audiences
Targeting the right users is key to successful Facebook advertising. Facebook has billions of global users, so finding those most likely to be interested in your brand or product requires using Facebook‚Äôs audiences feature.
Audiences is a section within Ads Manager where you can create lists of people to target with your ads. You can display ads to two audience types: custom audiences and lookalike audiences.
Custom audiences are made of customer lists, website traffic, or other data you‚Äôve collected. Upload a file of email addresses, phone numbers, and any other contact information you‚Äôve collected from customers or leads to create this type of audience. Facebook matches the information back to its own users, so you can target them directly with your ads.
Custom audiences are great for objectives like re-engaging past customers with new products or reaching email subscribers who haven‚Äôt yet made a purchase.
Lookalike audiences consist of people who share similar characteristics to your existing customers and are therefore likely to be interested in your business. Build a lookalike audience based on visitors to your Facebook page, Facebook‚Äôs demographics, or one of your custom audiences.
Next, choose the data you‚Äôll use to create a custom audience.

Start selling products on Facebook
Shopify comes with powerful tools to help you list, promote, and sell products on Facebook and Instagram. Create product collections, showcase your brand, and make sales on Facebook from one place.

4. Retarget your website visitors
Someone who has visited your website, added something to their cart, or followed you on Instagram is more likely to consider buying something from you in the future‚Äîthey might just need a little encouragement.
If you‚Äôve ever browsed a brand‚Äôs website and then visited social media, only to see an ad from the same brand, you‚Äôre familiar with ad retargeting.
Meta‚Äôs retargeting ads are called Advantage+ Catalog ads. You can create them by harnessing data collected with your Meta pixel in combination with your store‚Äôs product catalog to show Facebook users products they previously were interested in.
If you‚Äôre using Shopify, add the Facebook sales channel to easily sync your product catalog.
Aside from retargeting past purchasers or website browsers, you can also use this dynamic form of advertising for sales prospecting. Facebook will show users products from your store it believes are relevant based on their profile data, even if they haven‚Äôt visited your website before.
Next, learn how to upload your product catalog and create Advantage+ Catalog ads.
5. Try different Facebook ad types
The most exciting part of creating a Facebook ad is coming up with the creative‚Äîthe visuals and text that make up your ad.
Follow the instructions in Ads Manager to begin creating your first campaign. You‚Äôll be asked to select an overall objective and a specific goal, as well as a budget and an audience.
The best type of ad to create depends on your objective and your audience‚Äôs preferences. Here are the main types:


Single image ads: The standard Facebook ad format, single images are easy to make and can be highly effective.

Video ads: Show off your product or brand and capture viewers‚Äô attention with in-feed video. You can create video ads in Meta Ads Manager or boost a video post from your Facebook page.

Carousel ads: Include up to 10 images or videos in a single ad, each with its own link. Users can scroll through carousel ads by swiping on their devices.

Collection ads: This ad format makes it easier for people to browse and buy your products. Collection ads include a cover image and display multiple products beneath.

Next, learn the differences between the main types of Facebook ads.
6. Stick to Facebook‚Äôs ad specifications
There‚Äôs a lot to keep in mind when running a successful Facebook advertising strategy, including Facebook‚Äôs required dimensions, file types, and file sizes for each ad format.
When creating Facebook ads for your business, you‚Äôll want to stick to the recommended character counts and image resolutions. For instance:


Image ads must be at least 1080 by 1080 pixels in resolution and below 30 megabytes in size. They can contain up to 80 characters of text.

Video ads need to be provided in MP4, MOV, or GIF formats and can contain up to 125 characters of primary text.

Carousel ads should contain between two and 10 cards in a square ratio, with up to 80 characters of text. 

Collection ads should contain square image or video files and text up to 125 characters. They must link to a landing page URL.

Next, view the latest Facebook ad sizes and specifications.
7. Budget for Facebook ad costs
As you create campaigns, you‚Äôll choose whether you want to set a daily or lifetime budget. Then, when your ads go live, Meta will charge you per impression.
Deciding how much to spend on Facebook ads depends on several factors:


Business finances: Your overall marketing budget.

Product cost: Expensive items generally have a higher customer acquisition cost.

Ad objective: Sales-focused ads usually cost more than those with awareness-focused objectives.

Give your Facebook ads a fair shot by allocating enough budget to achieve your goal. Once your ads are published, you also need to allow time for Facebook‚Äôs Learning Phase‚Äîthe period when its algorithm examines your data. You can use Meta Advantage campaign budget to automatically manage your campaign budget across ad sets to get the best results.
However, there‚Äôs no minimum spend on Facebook, and you don‚Äôt need to commit to any set-up costs. You might even choose to focus on free Facebook marketing strategies and use ads only as a supplement.
Next, find out what Facebook ads cost in 2024.

Tips for running Facebook ads
Use these recommendations to help you create ads that convert, reach potential customers, and get better results from your Facebook advertising strategy.
Browse the Meta Ad Library for inspiration
Not sure where to start with ad creative? The Meta Ad Library is home to a comprehensive collection of ads currently running on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Search by brand name to find ads your competitors are running, see how they‚Äôre promoting their products, and then use this information to inspire your own ads.
Be authentic
Consider your brand‚Äôs tone of voice. Is it funny? Witty? Corporate? The more authentic your ads, the more likely people will be to interact with them and learn about your product. 
Show images of people using your product
When people are scrolling through their feeds, they see tons of photos and videos. If you want to get them interested in your ad, use creative that shows people benefitting from your product. If you want to include standalone product shots or videos of your product, use carousel ads to give people the option to choose what they want to see.
Give ads time
It might be tempting to make changes to your ad targeting if you don‚Äôt see activity quickly. But it‚Äôs important to be patient while the Facebook algorithm learns who is most interested in your content. If you aren‚Äôt sure whether to turn off an ad, try waiting until it gets at least 1,000 impressions before making a decision.
Choose ad objectives first
Before you create your first campaign, identify the metrics that matter most to your business‚Äîwhether to increase sales or brand awareness. To create strong ad campaigns, you‚Äôll want to make sure your campaign elements, from creative to audience targeting, tie into the main objective.
Combine ad types for more impact
Videos are great for telling your brand story, while images can help show different benefits of your product. Use a combination of ad formats to test that resonate with your audience, then invest in what‚Äôs working.
Show ads across channels
Meta Ads Manager lets you run ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network. You can also show ads on specific devices to target people based on the devices they prefer using. Don‚Äôt limit yourself to a single platform. Take advantage of Facebook‚Äôs multiple products by having your ads dynamically show up where your customers are most likely to spend time.
Facebook ad strategies
Whether it‚Äôs your first or fifth Facebook advertising campaign, use the following ideas to get more leads and sales from your efforts.
1. Promote top-performing content
Did you write an organic post that‚Äôs getting lots of views and likes? Turn it into a Facebook ad. The same goes for any marketing content you have on Instagram or TikTok. High-performing organic or off-platform content is a good indicator that viewers will respond to the same content as a Facebook ad.
You can also repackage content into different ad types. For example, you can take the core points of a high-performing video and turn them into a slideshow with images. 
2. Work with influencers 
Influencer marketing is a great way to reach new audiences online. Team up with influencers in your niche to collaborate on ad creative and promotion. Influencers can run ads from their personal Facebook and Instagram accounts to drive product sales and lower campaign costs.
3. Create an ad funnel
Prospecting and retargeting are both important audiences to target, but they generally work best when done together to create a marketing funnel.
A funnel is a marketing strategy designed to guide customers along a purchasing journey. A funnel-based approach to marketing focuses on tailoring your advertising depending on your audience‚Äôs intent to purchase and familiarity with your brand and products.
Creating a funnel on Facebook can be done by targeting a cold audience of prospective customers, such as a lookalike audience or a behavior-based audience in one campaign. Then retarget those who visit your website in another campaign. As you scale your Facebook advertising budget, your funnel can become more intricate, with multiple campaigns to target customers at different points along the funnel.
Why start advertising on Facebook?
With so many options, deciding where to spend your marketing budget can be difficult. What makes Facebook particularly attractive to new and experienced business owners boils down to three things:
It drives traffic from an active user base
Facebook is a place where many people connect with family and friends. Meta‚Äôs products are reportedly used by more than three billion people, and many of those users spend more time on Facebook than on competing social networks.
Meta, the company that owns Facebook, also owns Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, more mobile apps accessible to Facebook advertisers through its advertising platform. That‚Äôs a lot of active, engaged traffic to drive to your website.
It targets customers based on interests and behaviors
Facebook is designed for sharing personal updates and information with your network, such as vacation photos, new songs you‚Äôve discovered, or relationship statuses.
All the likes and connections made on Facebook and Instagram create detailed user profiles advertisers can tap into through targeted ads. Facebook advertisers can match their products against a long list of users‚Äô interests, traits, and behaviors, resulting in a higher likelihood of generating a lead.
It generates brand awareness
Large and small businesses often have Facebook and Instagram business pages they use to connect with fans and customers.
When you decide to use paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, you can opt to have them come from your brand‚Äôs social pages. This often results in increased brand exposure and new followers for your company, which is one of the benefits of advertising on social platforms.
Grow your business with Facebook ads
Facebook ads are designed to be easy to use for those with little digital marketing experience, making it an attractive form of self-serve marketing for any business.
If you take the time to learn the basics of Facebook advertising, set up your account correctly, and launch a campaign, Facebook ads can continue to fuel your business as it grows.

What is a social media campaign?
A social media campaign is a coordinated set of marketing actions across one or many social channels. The tactics share a common purpose and are designed to reach your company‚Äôs goals.
They‚Äôre usually part of an omnichannel strategy. Components of a social media campaign include:

Organic posts
Paid promotions
Contests and giveaways
Branded hashtags
User-generated content
Creator and influencer partnerships
Accurate reporting


How to plan the best social media campaigns
Before you can get creative with your campaign, you need to do your research. And this starts by putting an ear to the digital ground and listening‚Äîto both your audience and competitors alike.
To design the strongest campaigns possible, start by listening to what your audience is saying on social. Using an AI-powered social listening tool like Sprout to analyze conversations across all social networks enables you to do three crucial things to build your campaign:
1. Understand your target audience
When you don‚Äôt begin by listening to your audiences and build campaigns around what they actually care about, you might end up pushing out content that just isn‚Äôt quite right.
Social listening enables you to analyze your target audiences‚Äô conversations about your brand, product, competitors and existing campaigns. And that makes it possible to extract the topics that matter to your target audience and develop campaigns and messaging that resonate.

2. Do a competitive analysis to set yourself apart
A competitive analysis can also help you understand where you fall among your competitors‚Äîwhere they fall short and where you outpace them. Knowing your competitive position can help you set goals for your campaign. For example, using social listening during a competitive analysis can help you understand metrics like share of voice. You can understand how you stand out from the competition and how you need to tailor your campaign to improve your SOV.

3. Analyze campaign performance
AI-powered social listening tools enable you to go beyond measuring performance metrics to actually understand how audiences feel about your campaigns.
Understanding how past campaigns were received is helpful when crafting new ones. But it can also be helpful in the moment if you need to adjust a campaign that isn‚Äôt getting the right reception.

How to run a successful social media campaign
To run your high impact social media campaign from start to finish, use this three-step process.
1. Brainstorm social campaign themes
Generate social media campaign ideas by asking your team (and teams outside of social) these questions:

What are your target audience‚Äôs challenges?
How does your brand help overcome them?
What do we want to accomplish with a social media campaign?

During the ideation stage of your social media campaign, it‚Äôs imperative to consult with teams from other business functions to ensure you have a complete understanding of your customers, your products and your competitive landscape. The insights you glean from other teams can inform and bolster a campaign to make it even more audience-driven. In fact, The Sprout Social Index‚Ñ¢ revealed that 65% of marketers agree other departments inform their social efforts.

The success of campaigns like Nike‚Äôs #MambaDay tribute shows how powerful a well-executed, emotionally resonant idea can be.
2. Build out your creative and content
Once you ground yourself in the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your campaign, it‚Äôs time to build out the content. Here are some sources of creative inspiration that will help make your next social campaign truly memorable.
Partner with influencers and creators
Influencers and creators are already masters of creating content that resonates. They‚Äôve built their followings based on engaging content they share on social. With their expertise, they can produce unique content for your brand that strikes a chord with their community.
Most importantly, influencers bring a key element to your campaign: authenticity. Which, according to the Index, is the number one thing consumers don‚Äôt see enough of from brands on social.
Align with the customer journey
Not every piece of content you produce needs to align with all members of your target audience across the sales funnel. Instead, shift your focus to create content specific to where your campaign audience is in their buying journey.

For example, in the awareness stage, your goal is to increase the number of people who know about your brand, services and offerings. The content you produce within this stage needs to be eye-catching, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to speak directly to what your brand has to offer. The focus here is to grab your audience‚Äôs attention. ‚ÄúEdutainment‚Äù content‚Äîsocial posts that entertain and educate‚Äîis perfect for this journey stage. Think infographics and how-to videos.
Share user-generated content¬†
The most memorable brands on social have the best products and services, according to the Index.
By reposting user-generated content (UGC), you fulfill your audience‚Äôs expectations while saving your team time and creative resources. And your brand advocates are delighted to be featured by your brand and have a chance to grow their following. So, tapping into UGC is a win-win-win.
Post content formats your audience wants to engage with
Short-form video has been king for a while, and that remains true. The Q4 2023 Sprout Pulse Survey found that 81% of consumers want marketers to focus on short-form content production.
But remember that your audience‚Äôs preferences might differ slightly from the general population, so it‚Äôs important to factor in your most successful content types and themes using your organization‚Äôs own benchmark or historical data.
Size up the competition
If you‚Äôre running out of content ideas to fuel your social campaigns, turn to your competitors for inspiration. Your brand and your competitors may be targeting similar ideal customer personas, so zero-in on where their social efforts are winning share of voice. What are they doing that works? Where are they missing the mark?
Be careful not to mimic your competitors‚Äô content, but instead use their social strategies as a catalyst for your creative ideas.
3. Choose your metrics and measure success
Choosing the right social media metrics to track and analyze is vital to properly gauge the success of your social media campaigns, and how well your campaign translates to reaching business goals. With the tremendous amount of social data now available, be sure to choose metrics that align with your objectives. For a complete deep-dive, check out this video that walks you through the 17 most important social media metrics.
When it comes to tracking campaigns, engagement metrics‚Äîsuch as the number of unique people who have clicked, liked, commented on or shared your posts‚Äîtypically provide the most compelling data to determine your campaign‚Äôs overall effectiveness.
Once you determine the metrics that matter most to your campaign, start measuring your success and reporting on your social media analytics. Measuring performance throughout your campaign enables you to make adjustments to your social media strategy and content using real-time audience insights.
4. Use technology to manage your campaign from start to finish
To keep your campaign organized‚Äîfrom ideation to content creation to making sense of your metrics‚Äîuse a social media management platform like Sprout. With Sprout‚Äôs Campaign Planner features, create everything you need to run a successful campaign in one place, including briefs, creative assets and analytics reports.

4 creative social media campaign examples to inspire you in 2024
Some of the best social media campaigns have joined the ranks of the greatest creative efforts in advertising history.
To help you get inspired, here are some attention-grabbing creative social media campaign examples to get your creative gears turning.
1. LEGO‚Äôs Botanicals Challenge
LEGO never fails to create fun content. And recently, they leaned into their slogan ‚Äúadults welcome‚Äù with a social campaign built to bring attention to new additions in their Botanicals Collection‚Äîa range of flower-building sets.
LEGO chose the perfect time to promote these new flowery sets‚Äîin the lead-up to Valentine‚Äôs Day. Their social campaign consisted of a few pieces (no pun intended). On TikTok, they featured a weekly LEGO Botanicals Challenge where florist creators were challenged to make creative displays using Botanicals sets.


 @lego 
Bryce is bringing the outside in this week on the LEGO Botanicals Challenge‚Äã. ‚Äã Watch the whole thing: @FLOWER BOY  ‚Äã #flowertok #flowersareforever #legobotanical #lego 
 ‚ô¨ original sound – LEGO 

 
On Instagram, they posted beautiful Valentine‚Äôs-themed displays and LEGO Botanicals being built by a former contestant on The Bachelor.
And their campaign was taken offline with ‚ÄúLe Florist‚Äù‚Äîa LEGO store that was transformed into a florist shop populated with LEGO flowers and bouquets.


 @lego 
What do you call a florist who builds LEGO flowers? Le Florist ü§å #LEGO #LEGOFlowers #LEGOBotanicals
 ‚ô¨ original sound – LEGO 

 
The takeaway: We don‚Äôt all have hire-a-former-Bachelor-star budgets. But the takeaway from LEGO‚Äôs campaign is less about the flashiness and more about the creativity. Their team gave LEGO Botanicals practical, fun applications that were all about connections, celebration and the Valentine‚Äôs Day holiday.
Think about how you can involve customers and creators in a fun way, like the Botanicals Challenge‚Äîand how you can connect your campaign to people on an emotional level.
2. McDonald‚Äôs ‚ÄúW‚Äù flip and Grimace‚Äôs social media takeover
We just couldn‚Äôt choose between these two campaigns. Most recently, you may have noticed that McDonald‚Äôs has been flipping the classic golden arches into a less-classic golden ‚ÄúW.‚Äù
McDonald‚Äôs has been temporarily calling itself ‚ÄúWcDonald‚Äôs‚Äù in honor of how the massive chain is often portrayed in many manga, TV show, graphic novels and video games. On the digital front, they‚Äôve changed their social channels to reflect this new approach.

And their social content is filled with manga-inspired art and WcDonald‚Äôs shorts inspired by the medium.

It‚Äôs no question that McDonald‚Äôs knows how to have fun on social. And that was also apparent when their character took over posting on their social accounts to promote the Grimace Shake, giving the character a unique voice.

The Takeaway: The WcDonald‚Äôs campaign shows that McDonald‚Äôs is tapped into how their brand is referenced in media and culture. This is where social listening can help you do the same‚Äîuse it to understand how people are referencing your brand and if there are any trends you can join in on.
And the Grimace takeover is a great example of how your brand can have some fun on social. Do you have any characters you can hand the mic to? And if not, what creator or even employee takeovers make sense to lean into?
3. #ShotOniPhone and #YourShotPhotographer
These two campaigns aren‚Äôt new, but they‚Äôre impactful and have staying power.
You‚Äôve no doubt seen Apple‚Äôs #ShotOniPhone before‚Äîyou may have even used it: to date, there are 29.6 million posts using the hashtag on Instagram alone.
And that content and hashtag have been repurposed into countless billboards, commercials and ads for the brand, taking social offline.

Similarly, #YourShotPhotographer by National Geographic is a hashtag that unites Nat Geo‚Äôs photo community. They‚Äôve also turned to Instagram to create a space for their Nat Geo Your Shot community, and amassed a following of 6.6 million.

The takeaway: Both of these campaigns are ongoing, and are a stellar example of how you can source UGC and inspiration directly from your community‚Äîcelebrating your diverse and loyal audience in the process. Your community can fuel campaign concepts and content and bring your brand to life in a new way.
For your next campaign, think about how you can create a hashtag to gather UGC, drum up excitement and even create community amongst your audience.
4. Adidas ‚ÄúOriginals‚Äù campaign
We love when a brand gets cinematic. The brand‚Äôs 2023 ‚ÄúOriginals‚Äù campaign celebrates the sports celebrities and everyday people alike who embody the brand.
As a core part of this campaign, Adidas created several short films shared across their social channels, based on three of their iconic shoes: Gazelle, Superstar and Samba, which each film is named after.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsEBKATzLGw
They shared these films on their YouTube channel and leveraged Instagram to show previews of each film in Reels, connecting their content with the hashtags #WeGaveTheWorldAnOriginal and #AdidasOriginals.
The takeaway: We‚Äôre not saying you need to create high-production films or hire celebrities for your next campaign. But we are saying that you should tap into the storytelling angle behind your brand and product. Adidas did this beautifully, highlighting and honoring their audience, history and product in this campaign.
‚Äã‚ÄãMore social media campaign examples by network
Like these examples, many of the most successful social media campaigns span multiple networks simultaneously‚Äîwith most translating to channels outside of social. But if you‚Äôre looking to create a network-specific campaign or tailor your campaign to different network specifications, here are some helpful resources.

How to create KPIs and benchmarks for a social media campaign
Two of the most important parts of a social media campaign are setting the appropriate social media goals and measuring performance. This is crucial if you want to create stronger campaigns in the future, quantify ROI and business results and report to stakeholders.
Here are a few tips that will help you set KPIs and benchmarks for your social media marketing campaigns.
Identify the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind your campaign
Knowing the key outcomes that matter most to you will help identify and inform your KPIs. If your goal is awareness, then impressions, reach, share of voice and video views will be key for you.
If your goal is to drive sales and website traffic, then leads, clicks, trials, downloads, conversions and website traffic will be key. And many of these are easy to track in Google Analytics by using UTMs.
If your goal is a better brand perception, tracking sentiment will be crucial.
Pro tip: There are three engagement metrics that are universal among the major social networks:

Clicks: Users are only going to click on content that interests them. If you experience high clickthrough rates, your content is intriguing enough for users to want to see more, meaning that your content is effective.
Likes: If your content resonates with an audience and is receiving a high number of likes, it will naturally gain popularity (and hopefully collect more clicks).
Shares: Clicks and likes are good indicators of audience interest. However, when users like your content enough to share it, you‚Äôve achieved the holy grail of relevancy and will increase your visibility.

See how you stack up against competitors
Once you know the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù the next step is to put a number to your goals. And one of the most helpful ways to do this is by benchmarking against your industry, competitors and yourself.
First, see how your brand stacks up against the competition‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your share of voice? And how is your content performing compared to theirs? Using a tool like Sprout‚Äôs competitive analysis listening tool or competitive analysis reports does this automatically, so you don‚Äôt have to do all the math yourself.

You can also measure campaign performance against industry benchmarks, like those found in Sprout‚Äôs 2025 Content Benchmarks Report. And don‚Äôt forget to benchmark against yourself, as well. Where is your share of voice and brand sentiment now? And what are your current performance metrics like? Pair where you‚Äôre at with your campaign‚Äôs purpose to understand what goals you need to achieve, and where you want to see that impact.
Set SMART goals
SMART goals are a framework to use when setting goals for your campaign, and social media channels overall. They are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-sensitive.
Ensure the goals you set for your campaign follow this framework to ease the process of setting goals, and to better track success.
Report on success
Don‚Äôt keep your campaign results to yourself‚Äîshare them with your team and relevant stakeholders outside of it, from senior leaders to customer care teams.
Reporting on your campaign will help you refine how you set goals in the future, and refine future campaigns. It will also give you the chance to celebrate and communicate the success and learnings of your current campaign.
From different channels to influencer content and paid vs. organic posts, there‚Äôs a lot to measure across campaigns. A tool like Sprout enables you to report on your campaign across channels, posts and types of content in one place with a robust suite of analytics and reporting tools.

20 factors the most successful social media campaigns have in common
As you prepare to run your social media campaigns, keep these 20 factors in mind.
1. Talk to customers
Gather insights to learn what customers think about your products and industry at large. Then you can create tailored social media campaign strategies that address specific challenges.
How to do this: Partner with your sales and success teams to learn about your customers. Whether you join a call, send out a survey or consult with your internal team, stress how customer intel will help you create better campaigns (and more sales).
2. Learn from people outside your business function
Some of the best creative ideas you‚Äôll find for social media campaigns come from outside the marketing department. Remember to consult internal teams like sales, R&D, product development and HR when crafting your campaigns.
How to do this: Regularly convene with teams outside of social media to boost your strategy and further your impact. Consider hosting a ‚Äúsocial media council‚Äù for key stakeholders to bring ideas to the table.
3. Give it a sustained effort
Being able to pivot quickly according to data findings is important. But abandoning a campaign messaging angle or visual approach within the first week or month doesn‚Äôt give your content enough time to saturate the market.
By pivoting too quickly, you risk diluting your brand story and recognition with too many different messages. This confuses your audience and ultimately gives your competitors an advantage.
How to do this: We recommend making campaigns at least three months long, and breaking your campaign plan into multiple phases. At the end of each, formally evaluate the data and come up with actionable steps to modify your plan if needed.
By using Sprout‚Äôs analytics tools, you can efficiently provide regular reporting updates to your team.

4. Bring in the music (and trending sounds)
Music (and trending sounds) can be a source of inspiration for your social media campaign. In some cases, you can even build campaigns around the perfect song. For others, content made with trending sounds makes for a timely complement to an ongoing campaign.
How to do this: Use resources like the TikTok Creative Center to stay in the know and browse sounds currently trending in your country.
5. Think beyond social
Like many of our favorite social media campaign examples demonstrated, the most effective campaigns have an omnichannel component. Where else would your audience want to interact with your content or your product?
How to do this: Consult with teams in charge of event planning, advertising and product design during your campaign brainstorm to make a business-wide impact.
6. Inspire on social, close in store
Even if your audience is made up of digital natives, there are no replacements for the in-person experience.
How to do this: Whether you have a brick-and-mortar location, pop-up shop or you‚Äôre sponsoring a booth at a conference, make an aspect of your campaign face-to-face wherever possible.
7. Maximize opportunities to create content
Thinking back to the LEGO example above, use real-life experiences as a chance to fuel your campaign content pipeline.
How to do this: Capture content of people interacting with your products, team members and spaces. You could even create a meet the team series, if it fits the goals of your campaign.
8. Make conversions a focus
Stay zeroed-in on your conversion strategy to fill the gaps between building brand awareness and driving purchasing decisions. Design campaigns built to have a tangible impact on your bottom line by optimizing your content and distribution strategy for conversion.
How to do this: Fortify your campaign content with strong call to action phrases and measure conversions. Adding UTMs to links makes measuring clicks, conversions and website traffic in Google Analytics easier. And monitor your performance metrics‚Äîespecially for paid content.
9. Use AI and automation
Hear us out‚Äîwe‚Äôre not saying you should design your entire campaign using AI copy unchecked (see: the Glasgow Willy Wonka experience). But AI and automation can make your workflows and ideation processes more efficient. Use these tools to speed up your campaigns from start to finish.
How to do this: Before your campaign launches, use AI-powered social listening to better understand your audience. During, use AI to help you generate customer care responses to your campaign content faster, and to measure ongoing sentiment. And after, measure your campaign‚Äôs success and how people felt about it with social listening and analytics automation.
Investing in a tool that does it all ensures you get the most bang for your buck. Check out Sprout‚Äôs suite of AI and automation capabilities.
10. Experiment with ephemeral content
Think beyond your primary feed when designing your campaigns. Today, almost every platform has their own version of ephemeral content. Use these capabilities to infuse your campaign with personality and less-polished, more personalized content.
How to do this: For inspiration, check out our complete guide to Instagram Stories.
11. Identify the influencers and creators to partner with
This is your sign to partner with influencers and creators as part of your campaign. They lend an authentic voice to your content and expand your reach into their relevant audiences.
When looking for influencers and creators to star in your campaigns, keep three things in mind: reach, resonance and relevance. The people you feature should understand each one.

12. Make customer care a priority
This may seem like putting the cart before the horse. But if you don‚Äôt have a robust customer care and engagement strategy during your campaign, you may be missing out on connection opportunities and the chance to convert an audience member into a customer.
According to the Index, 76% of consumers notice and appreciate when companies prioritize customer support. Ensure you prioritize this as you launch your campaign.
How to do this: If you work with a customer support team alongside your social team, get them up to speed on the campaign‚Äîespecially if it may result in an influx of messages.
13. Look to innovators
If you‚Äôre struggling to design high-impact campaigns, take a marketer you know and admire out to lunch, or approach them on social and ask for a quick chat. Come prepared with a set of questions and be as specific as possible. We recommend choosing the marketer(s) behind a particular campaign you were impressed by, and digging deep to find out what you can learn for your brand.
And research how top brands and marketing executives (including yours) operate. Stay alert to top campaigns (like the ones shared earlier in this article) and read interviews with CMO‚Äôs from best-in-class brands.
How to do this: We have some social media experts on our staff who are always happy to talk about how Sprout‚Äôs full suite of social media tools can help you leverage data to come up with new campaign ideas. And subscribe to blogs and newsletters that feature interviews and advice from leading execs.
14. Partner up
Can you think of any brands that would make good partners during your next social media campaign? These should be brands that:

Overlap with your brand‚Äôs target audience
Don‚Äôt overlap with your product offerings

How to do this: Build out a co-marketing strategy to expand your awareness with your target audience.
15. Plan for retention and acquisition
Retention and acquisition should be two different tracks in your social media marketing campaigns.
On one hand, you‚Äôre trying to keep and engage with the customers you already have. On the other hand, you want to acquire more customers.
Some content might appeal to both customers and prospective customers, but you should also create unique content to target each of these segments.
How to do this: In your content calendar, make sure you have posts and mini-campaigns devoted to each of these categories. Use a tool like Sprout‚Äôs internal tagging feature to group and categorize your social media posts based on retention and acquisition objectives. That way you can strike the right balance, while keeping an eye on performance.

16. Understand the digital customer journey
As a social media marketer, you need to understand the unique digital customer journey your followers are taking through the marketing funnel. Make sure you know how people interact with your content at every stage in the journey and across all your social channels.
How to do this: Create a customer journey map to guide your campaign‚Äôs content creation.
17. Better understand cultural norms on social
Take time to learn about the unique culture of social media. By being immersed in the culture, you will create campaigns that are better attuned to audience expectations and norms.
How to do this: Subscribe to industry newsletters and blogs, spend time on different social media platforms and learn to speak their language (and your audience‚Äôs) fluently.
18. Use SEO to inform content themes
The words and terms you want your brand to rank for on Google can overlap with what you want to be associated with on social. Connect with your SEO team to find out which search terms your brand is focused on and weave them into your social media campaign strategies.
How to do this: Read our guide to YouTube SEO strategy to learn how to use SEO best practices in your content development.
19. Stay on brand
Maintain a consistent brand voice across channels, and stay true to who you are. Even if the internet is talking about the Oscars or the latest TikTok challenge, you should only jump on those trending conversations if they make sense for your brand and are relevant to your campaign.
How to do this: Define your brand‚Äôs core values, and keep them in mind whenever you create social content.
20. Take care of yourself
Social media burnout is real. It can be easy to get caught up in campaign prep, but working yourself too hard will lead to creative blocks.
How to do this: Take a break. Move around your space. Take a walk around the block. Try a yoga class. Do whatever it takes to reinvigorate your brain so you can create your most successful campaign yet.
Design an industry-leading social media campaign
Running outstanding social media campaigns requires incorporating insights from across your organization and applying them to build compelling, attention-grabbing content.
With this guide, you will be prepared to conduct meaningful research, design creative content and report on metrics that demonstrate impact‚Äîthe essential steps for building a successful campaign.
For an extra leg up, we designed a social media campaign brief template to help you stay organized, launch on time, keep your brand on budget and align with stakeholders. Or check out our full list of social media templates.
